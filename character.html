                    The eldest son of the historical Tohno family, he was raised for some time by the Arima branch family. <br>
                    However, he was called back to Souya to live in the Tohno estate shortly after his father passed away. <br>
                    A childhood injury left him with the Mystic Eyes of Death Perception, giving him the ability to see the death of all things in the form of lines and points. <br>
                    He wears special glasses which prevent his eyes from seeing these things all the time. <br>
                    He may be an ordinary student, but his ability to visualize death has altered his very perception of it. <br>
                    The aftereffects of his accident, combined with the toll his eyes take, has left him with chronic anemia. <br>
                    During battle, he removes his glasses to use his Mystic Eyes of Death Perception. <br>

                    A royal member of the vampire race known as the True Ancestors. <br>
                    After suffering through a traumatic event, a naively innocent side of her was somehow released. <br>
                    She now lives as a free-spirited, almost childish, princess. <br>
                    She is incredibly powerful and, despite being a vampire, is able to survive in direct sunlight. <br>
                    She has no desire to threaten human society, instead hunting other vampires known as Dead Apostles. <br>
                    While pursuing her greatest enemy, she arrives in Souya, where Shiki lives. <br>
                    Although a fateful encounter awaits her and Shiki here, a story of an earlier possibility is about to unfold. <br>

                    After the death of her father, she inherits the role of leader of the Tohno family, a distinguished house in Souya. <br>
                    One year younger than her brother Shiki, she arranged for his return from the Arima family. <br>
                    Her flawless etiquette and bearing perfectly epitomize the daughter of a noble house. <br>
                    She is strict even on herself, rejecting such things as modern-day amusements and frivolity. <br>
                    Because of her prideful and strong-willed nature, many find her difficult to approach. <br>
                    Sensing a mysterious presence in her town, and determined to uphold the Tohno family name, she sets off into the night to investigate... <br>

                    The Holy Church, a major religion in Europe, does not take kindly to heresy. <br>
                    Ciel works as an executor for its specialized force known as the Burial Agency. <br>
                    Her calling? Hunting and destroying heretics in the name of the Lord. <br>
                    Like Arcueid, she wishes to destroy her mortal enemy and has come to Souya in search of him, deciding to blend in by posing as a regular student at the same high school as Shiki. <br>
                    She currently attends school as a senior, one year above Shiki, and is quite popular with many of the students there. <br>
                    They see her as both warm and cheerful. <br>
                    Her go-to lunch from the school shop is curry bread, <br>
                    and her favorite restaurant serves the best curry in town. <br>

                    Her quiet nature makes her true feelings difficult to read,and her formal way of speaking has led Shiki to see her as being rather mechanical.Her fighting skills are not quite on the same level as her sister, but she holds her own well enough. <br>

                    In battle, Kohaku can be seen wielding the sword she keeps hidden in her broom,calling on strange plants, and even dropping fire bombs from above as if by magic.How she is capable of such things is still a mystery to those around her. <br>
